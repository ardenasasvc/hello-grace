*welcome to your new keyboard* <br>
*here are some things to help you get started*

## technical specifications
- pcb/case: zsa ergodox base (no shine/no glow, not led compatible)
- switches: kailh browns, led compatible
- keycaps: Infinikey Pastel, rainbow core set
- primary cable: usb-a to usb-mini
- secondary cable: 3.5mm to 3.5mm (looks like a headphone jack)

## how to set up 
1. When you plug in your keyboard, the computer should be able to recognize it as an ANSI keyboard
    - macs typically ask you to press a specfic set of keys when it shows the setup dialogue 
1. [here is the setup](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/getting-started) page from the keyboard manufacterer
1. you should be able to use it normally.  I have installed a basic-ish layout for you, but it is 100% customizable.
1. You will need to make an account with ZSA to save and modify your layout, if you so desire.
1. The keyboard will be delivered with the below layout installed. 
<div style="padding-top: 60%; position: relative;">
